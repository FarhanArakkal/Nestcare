# Nest Care - Helping Pets Find Their Home

![Nest Care Logo](readme_img/lg.png)

Welcome to the Nest Care Flutter App project! Nest Care is a mobile application designed to address the needs of abandoned and stray animals. In our fast-paced lives, we often overlook the little creatures in our neighborhoods, assuming their presence is routine and insignificant. Nest Care aims to change this by providing a solution to help these animals find new homes.

## About Nest Care
In our busy lives, we never give a second thought to the little creatures wandering around our neighborhood. We consider it routine and nothing of significance. The ones at home are pretty clean, and vice-versa. So we decided to bring out a solution, which is to help them find their new home via our app. Throughout the app, you can find abandoned pets and rescued stray animals that are completely sterile and safe.

Using technology, we can connect you with our advanced medical bot, which is helpful for further doubts. Within the app, you're able to find a detailed version of vaccination, which is essential for them. We also provide doctor-recommended animal supplies that are pretty affordable.

Can't find someone to take care of your pets for a while? Don't worry! We have "pet sitting" - yes! you heard it right! As a new feature, we can find the right pet sitter in your nearest location. This application allows access to stray care organizations.

And that's not all! Nest Care also offers grooming, training, boarding, and a pet shop. Plus, we have another feature - we can map search the nearest vet center.
